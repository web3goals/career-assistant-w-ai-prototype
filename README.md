## ✨ Inspiration

The number of developers is growing every day. Because of this, companies need more and more resources and time to check their skills before hiring them.

To help developers find job more easily, and to help companies find the right people faster, I decided to create an AI assistant that will help build a great resume and get a dream job.

## 🔥 What it does

On one side, users complete technical interviews with AI chatbot, which gives out experience points for correct answers.

On the other hand, companies find the people with the best results on the explore page and contact them via chat or video call.

## ⚒️ How I built it

- XDC Network is used by the project as a blockchain for smart contracts that people can interact to create social profiles, complete interviews with technical topics and earn experience points, that can be reviewed by any company or startup.
- Huddle01 is used as a provider for video calls between users and companies.
- Push Protocol is used as a provider for chats between users and companies.
- ChatGPT is used as an engine for interviews with AI assistant.

## 🚀 What's next

There are many ideas on how to improve this project. It would be great to:

- Add more topics for interviews.
- Add code checking with the ChatGPT plugin.
- Make collaborations with schools for developers.
- Attract companies that need programmers.
