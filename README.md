## ✨ Description

Career Mate w/ AI is a web3 application that helps developers find job more easily and helps companies find the right people faster.

On one side, users complete technical interviews with AI chatbot, which gives out experience points for correct answers.

On the other hand, companies find the people with the best results on the explore page and contact them via chat or video call.

## ⚒️ How it's made

Aurora mainnet and testnet are used by the project as a blockchain for smart contracts that people can interact to create social profiles, complete interviews with technical topics and earn experience points, that can be reviewed by any company or startup.

Aurora mainnet contracts:

- Interview (ERC721) - 0x96E6AF6E9e400d0Cd6a4045F122df22BCaAAca59
- Profile (ERC721) - 0x02008a8DBc938bd7930bf370617065B6B0c1221a

Aurora testnet contracts:

- Interview (ERC721) - 0x96E6AF6E9e400d0Cd6a4045F122df22BCaAAca59
- Profile (ERC721) - 0x1e4712A93beEc0aa26151CF44061eE91DD56f921
